<br>"Well-paced, clearly-explained lectures by instructors."<br><br>"A thorough and highly applicable introduction to Bayesian modeling."<br><br>"Overall, I learned a lot. But I think it was because I had some background in Bayesian and spatial stat, and this workshop helped me to get response for the questions. Otherwise, it could be very confusing. Thanks."<br><br>"This course was an exercise in Bayesian praxis. It provided tools to implement theories I had only read about but couldn't figure out how to implement with code."<br><br>"The instructors were very knowledgable on the topic and packed a lot into two days. They were very open to questions and diving deeper on topics when students asked."<br><br>"This was a compelling workshop taught by people who know their material.  Thorough without getting bogged down in the weeds, and practical examples are provided with pre-written scripts to follow."<br>

<br>"Wonderful course reviewing Bayesian modeling from basic concept to cutting-edge."<br><br>"The workshop provided a helpful, programming-centric introduction to Bayesian Modeling in an environmental health context."<br><br>"This is an efficient, in-depth course with lecture/lab pairs on topics including Bayesian workflows, temporal models, spatial models, and and non-parametric models. The course gives hands-on practice with the tools used for these analyses, with a focus on NIMBLE, but opportunity to work with INLA and ensemble models."<br><br>"It was a very interesting and fascinating course! I would recommend everybody to take the course. The only tip I would give is that you familiarize yourself with Bayesian Statistics beforehand."<br><br>"I was highly satisfied with the overall workshop structure and content. Learning Bayesian modeling from the basics to its applications brought me a lot of joy."<br><br>"This course was a great overview of how Bayesian models can be used within the environmental health/ public health arenas. User friendly with very knowledgeable instructors that made me excited to incorporate Bayesian models into my research!"<br><br>"The Bayesian team was really nice and answered several of our questions and concerns."<br><br>"Really wonderful practical introduction! I feel like I am ready to test out some of these methods in my own work."<br><br>"The workshop was a meticulously prepared, and every detail was thoughtfully addressed. It was an inspiring experience to have the opportunity to learn from world-leading experts in the field."<br>
